# test-therapy-app
A test project for a Flask part-time position at Charleston Children's Therapy Center.

## Project Description
This task is meant to take no more than 60–75 minutes total. Please do not over-engineer.
🛠️ Mini Build Task
Build a simple Flask application with the following:
• A form with the fields: Patient First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, and Therapist Name.
• A `/submit` endpoint that processes the form and stores it in a SQLite database.
• A confirmation page that displays the entered info.

Please use:
• Flask (no frameworks like Django)
• HTML templating with Jinja2 (no React/Vue)
• A clean and readable folder structure (`app.py`, `templates/`, `static/`, etc.)

Optional: Include basic validation (e.g., no empty fields, date must be in the past).
🧪 Add-On Questions
Please answer the following questions briefly after completing the mini-project:
1.	1. Explain how your app handles form validation. What happens if a required field is missing or the date is in the future? (3–5 mins)
2.	2. If we wanted to extend the app to support therapist logins, how would you structure that? (5–7 mins)
3.	3. How would you deploy this app to a HIPAA-compliant cloud environment? (5–10 mins)
4.	4. Where would you place the code that initializes the database and why? (3–5 mins)

Please send back a ZIP file of your codebase, with your responses to the questions either in a README or included here.
Estimated Total Time: 45–75 minutes
